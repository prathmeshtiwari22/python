CODE :

def Factorial(n):
    fact=1
    if n==1 :
        fact=1
    else :
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            fact=fact*i
            print("THE FACTORIAL OF {} IS {}".format(i,fact))
    return fact
n=int(input("the number for which factorial you wanted :"))
s=Factorial(n)
print(" the factorial of the number {} is {} ".format(n,s))

OUTPUT:
the number for which factorial you wanted :5
THE FACTORIAL OF 1 IS 1
THE FACTORIAL OF 2 IS 2
THE FACTORIAL OF 3 IS 6
THE FACTORIAL OF 4 IS 24
THE FACTORIAL OF 5 IS 120
the factorial of the number 5 is 120
